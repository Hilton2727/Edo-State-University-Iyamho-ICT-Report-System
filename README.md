## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- **Frontend**: React app (in `src/`, built with Vite)
- **Backend/API**: PHP (in `api/`)
- **Database**: MySQL (SQL file in `api/Sql/database.sql`)
- **Assets**: Images, icons, etc. in `public/`
- **.htaccess**: For Apache routing and security

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for frontend)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) or any Apache + PHP + MySQL stack (for backend)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for cloning)

---

## üö¶ Setup Instructions

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone or Download the Project

Extract or clone the project into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory (usually `C:/xampp/htdocs/`):

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/Incident System/
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Place the `.htaccess` File

- Ensure the provided `.htaccess` file is in the root of your backend directory (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/Incident System/.htaccess`).
- This file is required for proper URL routing and security with Apache.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup

- Open **phpMyAdmin** (usually at [http://localhost/phpmyadmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin)).
- Create a new database (e.g., `incident_system`).
- Import the SQL file:
  - Go to the new database.
  - Click **Import**.
  - Select `api/Sql/database.sql` from the project.
  - Click **Go** to upload.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Database Connection

- Edit `api/lib/db.php` to match your MySQL credentials (host, username, password, database name).

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Frontend (Development)

```bash
npm run dev
```

- The app will be available at the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)).

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

- The production-ready files will be generated in the `dist/` folder.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ üöö Deploy to XAMPP htdocs (Production)

**Important:**
- After running `npm run build`, copy **all files and folders from the `dist` directory directly into your XAMPP `htdocs` root** (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/`).
- **Do not** place the build output in a subfolder. The app will not work if it is inside a subfolder.
- Also, copy the `.htaccess` file and the entire `api` folder into the `htdocs` root, as shown in the image above.
- Your `htdocs` directory should look like this:

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .htaccess
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bg
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ favicon
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ logo
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ placeholder
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ robots
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other files from dist)
```

- This structure is required for the application to work correctly with Apache and the PHP backend.

## üëë Admin Login Credentials

To log in as an admin, use any of the following emails with the default password:

üîë **Default Password:** `password`

üìß **Admin Emails:**
- `admin@edouniversity.edu.ng`
- `itsehhillary@edouniversity.edu.ng`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è You can change these credentials in the database after your first login for security.

## üíª Common Commands

| üè∑Ô∏è Command         | üìù Description                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| `npm install`     | Install frontend dependencies     |
| `npm run dev`     | Start frontend in dev mode        |
| `npm run build`   | Build frontend for production     |

---

## üìù Notes

- **API Endpoints**: All backend PHP files are in the `api/` directory.
- **.htaccess**: Required for clean URLs and routing. Place it in the backend root.
- **Database**: Always import the provided SQL file before first use.
- **Uploads**: Ensure the `api/uploads/` directory is writable for file uploads.

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

- ‚ùå If you see blank pages or 404s, check that `.htaccess` is present and Apache's `mod_rewrite` is enabled.
- üõë If you get database errors, double-check your credentials in `api/lib/db.php` and that the database is imported.
- üåê For CORS/API issues, ensure the frontend is making requests to the correct backend URL.
